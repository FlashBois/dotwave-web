<h1 align="center">🌊 DOTWAVE: The Shared Liquidity Backbone</h1>

<br/>

**DOTWAVE** is a next-generation blockchain protocol designed to solve liquidity fragmentation. By allowing multiple decentralized applications (dApps) to share a single, unified liquidity pool, Dotwave maximizes capital efficiency and streamlines the DeFi experience for users and developers alike.

<br/>

## 🌊 Overview
In the current DeFi landscape, liquidity is often siloed within individual protocols. Dotwave changes the paradigm by separating deposit logic from application functionality.

Every token deposited into the Dotwave pool acts as a **"liquidity multiplier,"** serving various financial services simultaneously without leaving the vault.

### Core Services (Available Now)
* **Token Swaps:** Low-slippage trading powered by deep, shared liquidity.
* **Lending & Borrowing:** Efficient collateralization with cross-margin capabilities.
* **Perpetual Trading:** High-leverage trading with a polished user experience.

## 🚀 Why DOTWAVE?

### The Motivation
The Solana ecosystem thrives on speed but often struggles with liquidity efficiency. Dotwave aims to provide a "backbone" where a single deposit can be utilized across the entire ecosystem, ensuring that capital is never sitting idle.

### Key Benefits
| For Liquidity Providers | For Service Users | For Developers |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Higher Yield:** Earn fees from multiple protocols at once. | **Cross-Collateral:** Use one deposit for swaps, lending, and perps. | **Fast Integration:** Build on top of existing pools. |
| **Capital Efficiency:** Deposits count as a multiple of themselves. | **Deep Liquidity:** Better prices and lower slippage. | **Reduced Overhead:** Focus on logic, not liquidity sourcing. |

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Frontend Framework:** [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Blockchain:** Solana (Rust/Anchor)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

<br/>

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture
The defining feature of Dotwave is the **bidirectional data flow** between the central pool and its features.

* **Logic Separation:** Deposit management is decoupled from specific app logic (swaps/lending), allowing for infinite extensibility.
* **On-Demand Liquidity:** Protocols source liquidity from LPs dynamically, allowing users to increase rewards while maintaining granular risk control.

<br/>

## 💎 Key Pillars
* **Composability:** Designed for easy integration, making it a "plug-and-play" liquidity layer for Solana.
* **Efficiency:** Aggregated liquidity creates new possibilities for arbitrage and capital utilization.
* **Transparency:** Open-source by design. We believe in financial transparency and verifiable code.
* **Extendability:** A modular framework that allows us to roll out new DeFi features (Options, Synthetics, etc.) seamlessly.
